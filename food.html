                <h2>Losing Weight</h2>
                <p>Losing weight primarily involves creating a calorie deficit, which means consuming fewer calories than your body burns. This can be achieved by eating nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods such as vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while avoiding high-calorie, processed foods. Portion control and mindful eating also play a significant role in managing calorie intake. Additionally, staying hydrated and avoiding sugary drinks can help reduce unnecessary calorie consumption. Combining a healthy diet with regular physical activity enhances the calorie deficit, making weight loss more effective and sustainable.</p>
                <p>While going on a diet, it is also important to give the body the proper nutrients it needs to function properly. Here are foods that you can eat with the goal of losing weight:</p>

                    <li>Spinach: Spinach is low in calories but rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as iron and magnesium. It helps keep you full while supporting healthy digestion and metabolism.</li>
                    <li>Salmon: Salmon is a great source of lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which promote muscle repair and reduce inflammation. It also helps regulate appetite by keeping you full longer.</li>

                <h2>Gaining Weight</h2>
                <p>Gaining weight involves consuming more calories than your body burns while focusing on nutrient-dense foods. A diet rich in healthy fats, proteins, and complex carbohydrates, such as avocados, nuts, eggs, and whole grains, provides the extra calories needed for weight gain while supporting overall health. Eating frequent, calorie-dense meals and snacks throughout the day ensures a consistent calorie surplus. Combining this with strength training can help build muscle mass and promote healthy weight gain.</p>
                <p>Here are some foods that will help with the gaining weight journey:</p>

                    <li>Whole Milk: Whole milk is rich in protein, healthy fats, and calories, making it a nutrient-dense option for weight gain. It also provides essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D.</li>
                    <li>Cheese: Cheese is high in protein, healthy fats, and calories, making it a calorie-dense food that supports weight gain. It also provides essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin A.</li>
                    <li>Bananas: Bananas are a good source of healthy carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutrient-dense option for weight gain. They also provide natural sugars for quick energy.</li>
                    <li>Pasta: Pasta is a high-carbohydrate food that provides sustained energy and calories for weight gain. Opt for whole grain or enriched varieties for added fiber and nutrients.</li>
